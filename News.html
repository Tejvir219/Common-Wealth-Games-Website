                    after they missed out in the recently-concluded Birmingham 2022 edition. However, the list of sports
                    released by the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) on Wednesday (October 5) still does not include
                    wrestling or archery.</p>

                <h1>TEAM ENGLAND LOOKING TO GOLDEN FUTURE AFTER BRILLIANT BIRMINGHAM 2022</h1>
                <p>A golden future awaits for Commonwealth Games England as they plan to build on a historic summer in
                    Birmingham.<br>
                    Across 11 thrilling days of action, Team England won a record 176 medals, 57 of them gold, more than
                    ever before.<br>
                    The showpiece gripped the nation for a fortnight but it took years of preparation to make sure
                    everything was perfect for the 438 English athletes competing. Commonwealth Games England was more
                    than just the athletes; hundreds of backroom staff and volunteers played their part in an
                    unforgettable summer.</p>

                <h1>Victoria 2026 to benefit from World Heritage site funding</h1>
                <p>With assistance from the Victorian Goldfields Tourism Executive, this partnership looks to bring a
                    successful bid for the Central Victorian Goldfields region, and to make it a World Heritage site in
                    future.<br>

                    Minister for Planning, Lizzie Blandthorn, said the Victorian Government would back the bid, with
                    this funding coming from Regional Development Victoria's Investment Fast-Track Fund; which looks to
                    support planning and design of projects.<br>

                    It will help identify which sites meet the World Heritage criteria and where would benefit best from
                    investment.<br>

                    The Central Victorian Goldfields covers approximately 17 per cent of the state's area; with the City
                    of Ballarat stating the World Heritage Listing and World Heritage Journeys can support the Victoria
                    2026 Commonwealth Games and the long-term plan of the area.</p>

                    with Australia leading 2-1. India had lost 4-5 and 4-7 in the first two Tests. The fourth match will
